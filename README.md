## Making Changs to the Codebase
### How to Contribute
1. Create a branch for your feature (see [below](#feature-branch-example) for an example)
2. Add your code
3. Create a Pull Request

### Git Branches
Below you can find an overview of the branches we are using.

```
- master (protected)
- dev (protected)
- feature
-- feature/#<Issue Number>_<little feature title>
-- feature/#<Issue Number>_<little feature title>
-- feature/#<Issue Number>_<little feature title>
```

### Feature Branch Example

An example for a ToDo list feature could look as following:

```
-- feature/#1_todo-list
```

## Commit Messages & Pull Requests

For consistency and easier readability, we would like to ask everyone to use the templates for Pull Requests and Issues that we provide.
They follow this pattern:

```
<subject> (A title to summarise what this is about)

<body> (A description of your PR, feature idea or issue)

Resolves #ISSUE_NUMBER
```

Note: It is important to add the #number for the issue the PR is resolving in order to close the issue accordingly once the PR gets merged. You can read more about this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
